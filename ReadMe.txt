INTRO: This project is css heavy. It looks like most of the effects will be created by flexbox, so it's definitely a good opportunity to learn it really well.

REQUIREMENTS
-Have 5 equal size sections
-Have a cool background in each of the sections
-Have text at the center of each section, which forms a sentence when you combine all sections
-When you click on a section, have it create an effect where it first slightly contracts, and then expands.
-When a section expands, have it reveal text on top and at the bottom, to form another sentence.
-When a transition happens, make sure it happens smoothly
