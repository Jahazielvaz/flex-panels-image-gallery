INTRO: This project is css heavy. It looks like most of the effects will be created by flexbox, so it's definitely a good opportunity to learn it really well.

REQUIREMENTS
-Have 5 equal size sections
-Have a cool background in each of the sections
-Have text at the center of each section, which forms a sentence when you combine all sections
-When you click on a section, have it create an effect where it first slightly contracts, and then expands.
-When a section expands, have it reveal text on top and at the bottom, to form another sentence.
-When a transition happens, make sure it happens smoothly

THINGS I'VE LEARNED
-I painfully made a serious discovery with destructuring. It took me forever to figure this out. With destructuring, it works on objects, and arrays but you have to make sure you use the matching datatype to destructure. So if you're destructuring an object, make sure you set up the destructure as an object. If you're destructuring an array, make sure you're setting it up with the array. If you have an array of objects, then set the array, and objects inside.
